=== Introduction to Large Language Models ===

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models designed to generate human-like text based on input data. These models have evolved significantly over the years, with notable advancements in architecture and performance.

=== Milestone LLM Architectures ===

1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Introduced in 2018, BERT revolutionized natural language understanding tasks with its bidirectional training.

2. GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): Developed by OpenAI, GPT series models have set benchmarks in text generation and dialogue systems.

=== Applications of LLMs ===

LLMs find applications in various domains such as natural language processing, chatbots, language translation, and more.
